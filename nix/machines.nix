# The single pane: which machine runs which roles. `{ name, settings }`
# mirrors tfvars' `roles = [{ name, vars }]` on purpose -- one shape to learn
# for the whole fleet.
#
# `kind` picks a profile from nix/profiles: whether this machine has firmware
# and a disk ("metal") or is a Proxmox container ("lxc"). It defaults to
# "metal".
#
# `base` is implicit and is never listed.
